Resources placed in this folder will be statically available when your exercise-type is deployed in Ville
using the relative paths like "VILLE/resources/testexer/example.png"

This is the most straight-forward way of referencing static references from non-Vaadin client-side code

Only name-space reserved for static resources of this exercise-type is this folder

The bit silly looking path with three resources-folders is due to Maven, Servlet 3.0-spec and Ville...
web-fragment.xml seems to be mandatory in order to leverage servlet 3.0 modular resource loading.

This file or any file named README will by default not be included when generating jar of this project

!!!
However, most likely you will not need this folder at all, and can ignore its existence
